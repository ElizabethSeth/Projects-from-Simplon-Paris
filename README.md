## Data Cleaning and Preparation:
I validated the data to ensure that all columns, data types, and values complied with the constraints of the target schema. Additionally, I detected and handled anomalies such as incorrect values, outliers, and discrepancies, including cases where products were sold but not listed in the products table and anomalies in pricing. I applied necessary transformations, such as mapping subcategories and adding new columns to ensure the data is correctly structured.
I updated the sales datamart schema to include the new sub_category column. Furthermore, I modified the ETL pipeline to ensure that this new subcategory data is correctly integrated and loaded into the sales table during the data pipeline process.
## EDA
I conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to detect any potential anomalies in the dataset. This analysis helped to identify patterns, trends, and outliers, ensuring the quality and integrity of the data.
After making the necessary changes, I thoroughly tested and validated the data integration to confirm that the modifications were correctly implemented and that the data is now being loaded accurately with all required fields, including the newly added sub_category.
